## ‚ú® Features
* Endless Gameplay: The obstacles are procedurally generated, creating an infinite and unique challenge every time you play.
* Dynamic Difficulty: The game's speed increases the longer you survive, demanding quicker reflexes and constant focus.
* Collision Detection: Robust collision logic to handle interactions with obstacles.
* Responsive Controls: Simple and immediate controls using Arrow Keys or A/D for a fluid gameplay experience.
* Built with Web Technologies: Demonstrates core game development principles (game loop, rendering, collision detection) using the HTML Canvas API and vanilla JavaScript.
* No Installation Required: Runs directly in any modern web browser without needing any special plugins or runtimes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
* HTML5: Structures the webpage, providing the core <canvas> element for rendering and containers for the UI (score, start/game-over screens).
* CSS3: Styles the entire application, including the game's retro theme, layout, and the start and game-over screen overlays.
* JavaScript: Powers all the game logic. This includes the main game loop, player controls, procedural obstacle generation, collision detection, and score tracking.
